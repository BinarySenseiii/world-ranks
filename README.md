## About The Project

If you're wanting to test your JavaScript skills this is the challenge for you. Use whichever JS framework you prefer and pull data from the REST Countries API.
The challenge is to integrate with the REST Countries V3 API to pull country data and display it like in the designs.
You can use any JavaScript framework/library on the front end such as React or Vue. You also have complete control over which packages you use to do things like make HTTP requests or style your project.

Users should be able to:

1. See all countries from the API on the homepage.
2. Search for a country using an input field.
3. Filter countries by region/name/subregion/popularity.
4. Click on a country to see more detailed information on a separate page.
5. Click through to the border countries on the detail page.
6. Pagination

I do not have access to the Figma sketch so the design is not pixel-perfect but i tried my bes.

## Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- tailwind css
- Flex / grid
- Desktop-first workflow
- Next.js
- TypeScript
- Rest Countries API
- Zustand
- Axios/React-query

## What I learned

Action packed project! I faced numerous challenges – juggling multiple filters with pagination, wrestling with TypeScript issues – but overcoming each hurdle became a valuable learning experience. In the end, the challenges turned into opportunities, and I emerged with a wealth of knowledge
